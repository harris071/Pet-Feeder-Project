Step 1: Understand and Define the Problem (Analysis) 
Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to design a low cost, programmable automated pet feeder for a local animal shelter that: 
•	Dispenses food for dogs and cats at scheduled time 
•	Monitor whether the food has been consumed or the amount of food that has been consumed
•	Alert staff if there is an issue 

Assumptions or limitations:
•	One type of pet food for both cats and dogs
•	Limited memory 
•	Shelter has Wi-Fi access 
•	Pets eat within 10 minutes of food being dispensed 

Inputs and Outputs: 
Inputs	              Outputs
Feeding Schedule 	   Servo Motor Activation
Bowl Weight Sensor 	 Alert Messages
Food level Sensor 	 Feeding Log
Type of Food	       LED/Buzzer notification
